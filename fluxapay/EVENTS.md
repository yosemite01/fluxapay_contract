# Fluxapay Contract Events

This document defines the on-chain events emitted by the Fluxapay smart contracts. Off-chain listeners (webhooks, indexers) can subscribe selectively using the standardised topic tuple.

## Topic Format

All events follow a three-element topic tuple:

```
(contract_symbol: Symbol, event_type: Symbol, entity_id: String)
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `contract_symbol` | Top-level namespace: `PAYMENT`, `REFUND`, `DISPUTE`, `MERCHANT`, `LINK` |
| `event_type` | Specific lifecycle transition (e.g. `CREATED`, `VERIFIED`) |
| `entity_id` | Primary identifier of the affected entity (payment_id, refund_id, etc.) |

The data payload always includes `merchant_id` and `amount` for payment events, enabling downstream indexing without a secondary lookup.
